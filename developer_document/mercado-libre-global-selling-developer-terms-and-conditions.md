Content by Developers or Application Users, or (v) the use of the
Application by Users of the Application, or (vi) the falsehood or
inaccuracy of any of the representations made by Developers under these
Terms and Conditions.  
For such purpose, Developers authorize Mercado Libre to act and
represent them in such claims, being able to execute, on their behalf,
such transactional agreements that it may deem appropriate and conducive
to avoid higher costs and/or contingencies. Likewise, Developers may not
execute transactional agreements without the prior consent of Mercado
Libre, which may not be rejected unjustifiably.

Mercado Libre will furnish Developers certain information, such as the

protect all the information furnished by Mercado Libre to Developers
under the Developer Program (including, without limitation, the
Confidential Information), and shall, at least, apply the same
protections applied to protect their own confidential information, which
may not be inferior to the ones set forth in the applicable regulations.
Developers shall adopt the information security measures, both physical
and computational, which are at least consistent with the best practices
of the industry, sufficient and adequate to ensure security and
confidentiality of the Confidential Information, in such a way to avoid
their tampering, loss, unauthorized consultation or treatment and that

Information, whether the risks be derived from human action or technical
means used.  
Upon accepting these Terms and Conditions, Developers expressly
authorize Mercado Libre to check the fulfillment of the confidentiality
liability set forth hereunder by means of an audit, whether in person at
the offices of Developers or remotely through access to the computing
systems of Developers or as determined by Mercado Libre, as agreed by
the parties on the place, date and time of the audit. Developers will
offer their full collaboration to Mercado Libre to perform the referred
audit.
