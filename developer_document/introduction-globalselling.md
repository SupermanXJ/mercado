## Best practices for listing items

This document is intended as a guide to good practice when posting an
item on Mercado Libre. We recommend following this document, in order to
have quality items, improving the exposure of these to buyers and
avoiding moderations or failures. See how to [create effective listings
in Mercado
Libre](https://sellers.mercadolibre.com/news/how-to-create-effective-listings-in-mercado-libre/).

  

Also remember that you can visit the [Seller Learning
Center](https://sellers.mercadolibre.com/) where you can find more
information and relevant tips to selling on Mercado Libre.

  

## A good title

For the [category
predictor](https://global-selling.mercadolibre.com/devsite/category-predictor/)
to work properly, the item [title must be clear and precise with the
following
recommendations](https://sellers.mercadolibre.com/news/how-to-create-a-good-title-for-your-listing//),
remember that **the title must always be entered in English**.

  

It is essential to formulate the titles in a clear way and avoid
repetitions that may confuse the buyer. The structure should be simple:
**product + brand + model + some specifications** that help identify the
product.

  

For example:

  

-   Cell phone iPhone 6s 64gb 2gb RAM Free
-   Short sleeve polo shirt Lacoste Striped Blue and white slim fit
-   Microwave Grill BGH Quick Chef B223D silver 23L 220V

  

Note that you will not be able to change the title if you have already
made a sale.

  

## Use quality photos

The photos of the item are very important, it is recommended to use a
maximum of 10 main photos with white background. [See tips for the
photos of your
listing.](https://sellers.mercadolibre.com/news/photos-are-your-shop-window-make-it-shine//)

  

## Variations

Use [product variations to
improve](https://global-selling.mercadolibre.com/devsite/variations-global-selling)
the quality of the publication of the product. Mercado Libre recommends
that the maximum possible combinations of variations per product should
be 100 variations per item.

  

This number facilitates the maintenance of stock, the updating of the
offer window, improves the seller's experience when buying, and allows
the response time when using our apis to be optimal. [Learn to enter
