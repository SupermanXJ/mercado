<div class="details__message">

A claim is a formal request that users can submit to express
dissatisfaction or issues related to a specific process. These claims
are essential for resolving problems, ensuring a positive user
experience, and maintaining the integrity of the service. Only four
types of resources can generate claims, each associated with a different
aspect of the transaction on the platform. The possible resources are
detailed below:

-   **Order**: This type of claim is generated from a purchase order
    made on the Mercado Libre platform. Users can file a claim if they
    experience issues with the order, such as discrepancies in the
    received product, errors in quantity, or any other inconvenience
    related to the order. This ensures that users can communicate any
    dissatisfaction and receive an appropriate solution, thereby
    maintaining trust and service integrity.
-   **Shipment**: shipment claims originate from the shipping process of
    a purchase on the Mercado Libre platform. Users can file a claim if
    they encounter problems with the delivery of the product, such as
    delays, products damaged during shipping, or logistical issues.
    These claims allow for quick resolution of incidents, improving the
    customer experience.
-   **Payment**: this type of claim is created in relation to a payment
    made through the Mercado Libre platform. Users can file a claim for
    payments related to purchases on the platform or any other type of
    transaction made through the Mercado Libre payment system. Issues
    that may prompt these claims include incorrect charges, payment
    processing failures, or disputes related to the transaction. This
    mechanism not only allows users to quickly resolve their issues but
    also helps the platform identify and correct potential failures in
    its payment system, enhancing reliability and customer satisfaction.
-   **Purchase**: purchase claims arise from a purchase made on the
    Mercado Libre platform. These claims focus on the purchase
    transaction and address issues such as defective products,
    discrepancies between the product description and what was received,
    among other inconveniences. Allowing users to file these claims
    improves transparency and facilitates a quick resolution, which not
    only reinforces customer trust in the platform but also helps
    identify and resolve flaws in the purchase process.

With the claim search resource, you can apply certain filters to obtain
more specific results based on the required fields detailed above.  
  
It is also possible to search by **pack\_id** and **order\_id**, you
will retrieve all claims indirectly related to the entered ID. For
example, when entering a **pack\_id**, the search will return all claims
linked to that pack through its orders, shipments, and payments.
Similarly, when searching by **order\_id**all claims associated with
that specific order will be displayed. This capability allows you to
manage and resolve incidents more effectively.

1\. Claim Typification: Each claim typification is associated with a
specific set of reasons. To obtain details about the reason a claim was
initiated, it is necessary to consult the reasons API.  
  
2. **Roles within the Claim**: The roles of the players are strictly
defined and cannot vary. The player *mediator* intervenes in the claim
only when it is in the dispute or recontact stages. Each player can have
a list of actions, but within the claim process, only one player has the
mandatory action throughout the entire process.
